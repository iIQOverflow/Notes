# 基础知识
### Two types of formal properties 
#### Safety Properties
**Something bad will never happen**

E.g. Mutual exclusion, No overtaking
#### Liveness Properties 
**Something good will eventually happen**

E.g. Deadlock freedom, Starvation freedom

### Progress Conditions  
#### Deadlock-free: 
**some thread trying to acquire the lock eventually succeeds.**
#### Starvation-free:
**every thread trying to acquire the lock eventually succeeds.**
#### Lock-free: 
**some thread calling a method eventually returns.**

**infinitely often some method call finishes.**

System-wide progress (but some thread may starve)
#### Wait-free: 
**every thread calling a method eventually returns.**

**each method call takes a finite number of steps to finish**

Per thread progress (so the system too)
